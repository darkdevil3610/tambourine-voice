# Tambourine

> Your Personal Voice Interface for Any App

An open-source platform for AI voice dictation that you can customize and personalize to your exact needs. Choose your models, write your prompts, make it yours.

**Platforms:** Windows, macOS | **License:** AGPL-3.0

## What People Say

> "I love this kind of project: open source, hackable, filling a gap in the voice ecosystem with a really useful codebase, pushing the boundaries of what you can do with 'voice AI engineering.'"
> — **Kwindla Hultman Kramer**, Co-founder / CEO, Daily (Pipecat)

> "When I saw this I knew we had to give it a try and it works brilliantly."
> — **Stuart Wood**, Speechmatics

> "Most of us speak around 130-160 wpm and type 40-50 wpm. That means speaking is about 3x faster than typing. I've been using Tambourine to dictate directly to Claude Code. I'm impressed."
> — **Derek Haynes**, Finchvox

## The Foundation of Voice Interfaces

You can build on top of Tambourine to create exactly the voice experience you need.

### Choose Your Models

Pick the STT and LLM that work for you. Use cloud providers or run fully local with Whisper and Ollama.

### Write Your Prompts

Customize how your speech gets formatted. Add your own rules, adjust the tone, define how punctuation works.

### Build Your Features

Implement features like backtracking corrections and list formatting your way. The logic is in prompts you control.

## Personalize Everything

These features ship by default, but they're implemented in customizable prompts. Modify them, extend them, or build your own.

### Personal Dictionary

Teach it technical terms, names, and jargon specific to your work.

- "ant row pic" → Anthropic

### Backtrack Corrections

Say "actually" or "scratch that" to correct mistakes as you speak.

- "at 2 actually 3" → at 3

### Smart List Formatting

Automatically format lists.

- "one eggs two milk" → 1. Eggs 2. Milk

### Your Own Ideas

The prompts and logic are yours to modify. Build what you need.

## Coming Soon: Context-Awareness

Tambourine will access surrounding context to make dictation smarter.

### App-Dependent Formatting

Automatically adapt to the app you're in. Emails get salutations, code editors get syntax-aware output.

### Selection Commands

Highlight text and say "make this more formal" or "translate to Spanish" to transform it in place.

### Voice Shortcuts

Create custom triggers like "insert meeting link" that expand to frequently used text.
