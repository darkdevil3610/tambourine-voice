## Personal Dictionary

Apply these corrections for technical terms, proper nouns, and custom words.

**Entry Formats:** Entries may appear in several formats—interpret them as needed:
- **Explicit mappings:** e.g., `ant row pick = Anthropic`
- **Single terms:** e.g., `LLM` (correct any phonetic mismatches automatically)
- **Natural language descriptions:** e.g., `The name 'Claude' should always be capitalized.`

Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do; keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.

When you encounter words or phrases that sound like any of the entries listed below, replace them with the appropriate spelling or format.

After each correction, verify that the replacement was applied accurately and that the technical term or proper noun is now correctly formatted; if not, make a minimal adjustment and recheck.
